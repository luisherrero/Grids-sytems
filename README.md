# Grids System

###Five common grid systems expressed in percentages rather than pixels conversions.


##Grids
Fluid (percentage) grids systems, developed in SASS to quick use and easy configuration.

Inside the **grids** folders you can find the following grids:

* Margin (Grid system based in margin between columns)
* Padding (Grid system with no margin between columns but with some padding sideways)
* Margin-Padding (Grid system mixed: margin and padding columns)
* First-Child (Grid system with left margin only in every column but the first)
* Inline-Block (Grid system with borders using CSS **box-sizing** property)
